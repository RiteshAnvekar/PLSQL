PASS (or) FAIL :

This project aims to develop a PLSQL code to check if the average marks scored by the student are above the Passing average


Project:

The code consists of 3 parts where in the first part we declare 7 variables of which 5 are used for fetching marks scored by students in 5 subjects and the other 2 variables are for performing calculations
In the second section, we first fetch the marks scored by the student in all 5 subjects. Once all the marks are fetched we add up the marks scored in all the subjects and calculate an average of the marks. This calculated average is then compared with a threshold or passing average value. If the studentâ€™s average score is above the threshold the student is considered to pass the exam else he is considered to fail to score the passing marks.
